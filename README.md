## Inspiration
In the pandemic, healthcare was one of the most important things for everybody. But on the other hand, the people with medical problems were not able to access them as the social-distancing norms and lockdowns made the process very complicated. Doctors who were taking care of COVID patients could not help other patients as it could lead to an outbreak. Therefore, a platform was required to help the patients and doctors both so that medical help could be given to everybody.

## What it does
The mobile application connects the patients and the doctors. The patients as well as the doctors can signup on the platform. Patients can ask for medical advice from the doctors. They have an option to select the doctor and they can also book appointments on the app. 
The medical history is saved in the account of the patient so a verified doctor can access the information to suggest treatment to the patient. All this can be done with the help of the app without the need of visiting the hospital. 

## How we built it
The mobile application is built using Android-Studio and Java. It is a native android mobile application. We have made classes for doctors and patients. We used Trello for the task division and management of the project.

## Challenges we ran into
Working with new technologies is always challenging. We learned mobile application development. We had to figure out a way to add the book an appointment feature.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we collaborated as a team and finally build the app. It will be very useful for the people and help save lives.

## What we learned
We learned app development, team-work, and the art of sticking to the goals for getting an outcome.

## What's next for NovaMed
We have planned few features that would love to implement which were not included due to time constraints:
- We planned to incorporate a chatbot for basic medical queries.
- A pill-verification system that could help the patients with the right medicines as wrong medicines could be dangerous for the health.
- Connecting the family doctor on the portal of the patient.
- Checking the pharmacy stock and ease the process of buying medicines.
- Remote monitoring of old-age and severe patients.
- Conduct Clinical Studies.
- Call the nearest hospital in case of any emergency.
- Fall detection for old-age people.
